# Shareable configurations

A sharable configuration is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package that exports a **semantic-release** configuration object. It allows to easily use the same configuration across several projects.

The shareable configurations to use can be set with the [extends](configuration.md#extends) option.

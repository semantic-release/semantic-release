# Shareable configurations

A shareable configuration is an npm package that exports a **semantic-release** configuration object. It allows for use of the same configuration across several projects.

Shareable configurations to be use can be declared with the [`extends` option](configuration.md#extends).

See [shareable configurations list](../02-extending/shareable-configurations-list.md) for examples.
